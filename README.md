### PS4
######For this i will refer to the text from their Github page:

Unfortunately at this time, PS4 does not have any external server support. However, there are ways around this by emulating a LAN game on your network on another device.

Note that this method will also work with any other Bedrock platform other than Nintendo Switch
Using a PC with a PlayStation 4
If you have a PC, you can use Phantom.

Using an Android Device with a PlayStation 4
If you have an Android device, you have several options:

Work in progress Geyser Android app
MC Lan Proxy (Trial)
MC Lan Proxy (Paid)
MC Server Connector
Using an iOS device with a PlayStation 4
If you have an iOS 14+ device, you can use BedrockTogether.
